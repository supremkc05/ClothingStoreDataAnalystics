Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate models:
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Model Evaluation

Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2 Score.
Perform cross-validation to assess model performance.
Visualization of Predictions

Visualize predicted vs actual costs using scatter plots.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries:
Open the Jupyter notebook individeual.ipynb and run the cells to see the analysis and results.
Results
